# Dockerize Jekyll

This is a very simple container to host jekyll based website

Dump your jekyll source in .
Add
```yaml
exclude: [docker-compose.yml]
```

to your _config.yml file to avoid exposing docker config in the website

Build your project

```bash
jekyll build
```

Build the container

```bash
docker-compose up
```

And see the result at http://localhost:8080
